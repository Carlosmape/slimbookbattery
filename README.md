# Slimbookbattery

Slimbook Battery 4 is the new version with new features that improves battery control and increases battery duration in laptops.

This update offers new possibilities to the users, thanks to the integration with other applications, services and drivers like TLP, intel_pstate, AMD and NVIDIA.

This means that this application it's not only compatible with SLIMBOOK computers but with other brands and computer manufacturers that work with Ubuntu and derivatives.

The application implements three different energy modes: «energy saving», «balanced» and «maximum performance». Each energy mode comes with default values but the user is allowed to change the most important values, to adjust or avoid errors in their hardware.

The energy save applications like TLP are based on "If I i'm not using it and consumes, I better turn it off". In this way the consumption of resources is reduced when the computer uses the battery. Slimbook Battery 4 uses this premise as a source of energy saving.
